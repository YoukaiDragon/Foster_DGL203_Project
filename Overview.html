        <p>
            The goal of my project is to create a website that hosts several games programmed in Javascript. These games will be sourced from my 
            Javascript assignments from this term, as well as my Javascript project, which will be one of the games. If needed to give the project 
            an adequate scope, additional game pages may be designed for games that are not actually implemented as well. The intent is to create a functional
            and stylish design, including animations on the main page. The main page will have a grid of thumbnails and names for each of the games that will allow
            the user to navigate to that page, while the game pages will have a button to return the user to the homepage.
        </p>

            The individual game pages will of course each be focused on the game itself, and I intend to give each page a unique background design to tie into
            the game on that page. Each game page will also have the controls listed below the game viewport, and where needed a modal will be used to display
            more detailed instructions.
