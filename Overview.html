        <h1>DGL 203 Project Overview Tyson Foster</h1>
        <p>
            The goal of my project is to create a website that hosts several games programmed in Javascript. These games will be sourced from my 
            Javascript assignments from this term, as well as my Javascript project, which will be one of the games. If needed to give the project 
            an adequate scope, additional game pages may be designed for games that are not actually implemented as well. The final design will use a mixture
            of transforms, animations, and static backgrounds / images for the backgrounds of the various pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main page will use a mxture of flexbox and grid to display thumbnails linking to the games. For the purposes of this and my Javascript project
            only some of the links will actually work, with the rest being for illustrative purposes as to how the page would be as an active website with more games
            The main page will also have a search bar, which, if feasable to do so, will be made functional, otherwise will again be simply illustrative of how the 
            site would look and work if it were a live and fully functional site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The search results page, whether fully functional or a pre-populated example of how it would look, will use flexbox to display a verticle list of games,
            with each entry having it's thumbnail image, title, and a brief description.
        </p>
        <p>
            The individual game pages will of course each be focused on the game itself, and I intend to give each page a unique background design to tie into
            the game on that page. Each game page will also have the controls listed below the game viewport, and where needed a modal will be used to display
            more detailed instructions.
